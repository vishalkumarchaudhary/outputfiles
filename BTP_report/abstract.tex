\textit{\quad 
In this project, learning through self-play algorithm has been explored and has been applied on connect4, 2048, cricket. Our task is to improve the training process of board games. During self-play, data is being generated for the model to learn. So if we create good data and explore more rewarding paths then our agent can learn quickly. For experimental purposes, we have tried the self-play algorithm in 2048 with a branching factor of 4. Further, in this project we worked on two important things.\paragraph{}
We have introduced KL-Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) and Thompson sampling for sequential game connect4. In Spite of these bound came from the solution of multi-arm bandit problem they show significant improvement over the existing bound which was being used in the algorithm.  \paragraph{}
Simultaneous games are more complex game than its sequential form because there is always randomness involved about the opponent. Learning through self-play algorithm has been implemented for sequential games but we have applied this algorithm on cricket in the simultaneous environment.
